## Callbacks

Callbacks are entry-points for custom code in the DCA. Using callbacks you
can modify static Data Container Array during runtime.

Callback functions are based on the event dispatcher pattern. You can register
one or more callbacks for a certain event and when the event is triggered, the
callback functions are being executed.

Callbacks are very similar to [Hooks][hooks], but always bound to a specific DCA table.

> #### info:: Note 
> Since Contao 3.2.0, you can also use [anonymous functions][closures] for DCA callbacks.

<tr>
  <td>paste_button_callback</td>

  <th>Callback</th>
  <th>Description</th>
